`rails-navigator` is a VSCode extension designed to make swapping between related rails files easier.

## Features

Currently, there is one command:

| Name                                              | Default Keybinding (Windows/Linux) | Default Keybinding (macOS) | Command ID                         | Description                                                                                                   |

| Rails Nav: Switch between spec and implementation | `ctrl+k ctrl+p`                    | `cmd+k cmd+p`              | `rails-navigator.toggle-spec-impl` | Switches between an implementation file such as `app/.../file.rb` to its spec file at `spec/.../file_spec.rb` |
